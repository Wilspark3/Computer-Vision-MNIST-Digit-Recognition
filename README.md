# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (MNIST)

This project implements a computer vision system that recognizes handwritten digits
from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Project Type
Computer Vision – Image Classification

## Dataset
- MNIST dataset
- Contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images
- Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale

## Approach
- Image normalization
- Building a CNN model
- Training the model on MNIST images
- Evaluating model accuracy
- Predicting handwritten digits from test images

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

## Output
- Training and testing accuracy
- Predicted digit vs actual digit visualization
- Output screenshots are included in the repository

## Result
The CNN model successfully predicts handwritten digits with high accuracy.
